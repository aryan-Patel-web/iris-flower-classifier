## 📊 Project Overview

The Iris Flower dataset is a classic dataset for pattern recognition. This project utilizes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression classification
- Model persistence using `pickle`
- An interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions


## 🧪 Features

✅ Classifies iris species based on:
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

✅ User-friendly UI built with **Streamlit**  
✅ Real-time predictions  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Easy to extend with new models or algorithms
